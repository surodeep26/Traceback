The program can be used to compare the positions of a star
using the different orbit types. The usage is

orbittypes <configfile> <epoch>

where <configfile> is the name of the configuration file containing
all the constants and input information (only Star1 is relevant),
and <epoch> is the time in years for which the orbit should be
calculated. It can be positive and negative.

The results are written to the terminal.

This is a simple example how to use the StarGalacticParam class.
See the file orbittypes.cpp how to do and how to modify it.
